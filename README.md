## A Responsive UI design based on the Financial Times (FT) website

My [version](https://oneiromancy.github.io/responsiveui/) tries to mimick the responsiveness of the 
website's design. 

This project was built with ReactJS because its component reusability features tend to facilitate the
maintainability of a large HTML codebase. Given the static nature of the FT website, GatsbyJS could be
an option to support the use of ReactJS in deployment instead of a templating engine such as handlebars.js, 
pug.js, etc.
